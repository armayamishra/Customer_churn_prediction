# Customer_churn_prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using deep learning models built with Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained to identify customers likely to leave based on behavioral patterns and historical data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, with a focus on optimizing predictive accuracy. Key techniques include feature engineering, neural network architecture design, and performance tuning. Ideal for exploring how deep learning can enhance churn prediction strategies.
